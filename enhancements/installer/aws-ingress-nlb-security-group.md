# Supporting Security Groups for NLBs on AWS through Ingress

## Summary

This enhancement proposes adding support for automatically creating and managing an AWS Security Group (SG) for Network Load Balancer (NLB) used by the default OpenShift Ingress Controller when deployed on AWS.

This feature will be opt-in via a configuration setting in the `install-config.yaml`, allowing administrators to enhance the security of their ingress traffic by provisioning a Service type LoadBalancer NLB with Security Group, similar to how Security Group is managed for Classic Load Balancers (CLBs) today. The implementation will primarily involve changes within the AWS Cloud Controller Manager (CCM), OpenShift Cluster Ingress Operator (CIO), and the OpenShift Installer.

## Motivation

Customers deploying OpenShift on AWS using Network Load Balancers (NLBs) for the default router have expressed the need for a similar security configuration as provided by Classic Load Balancers (CLBs), where a security group is created by CCM and associated with the load balancer. This allows for more granular control over inbound and outbound traffic at the load balancer level, aligning with AWS security best practices and addressing security findings that flag the lack of security groups on NLBs provisioned by the default CCM.

The default router in OpenShift, an IngressController object managed by Cluster Ingress Controller Operator (CIO), can be created with a Service type Load Balancer NLB instead of default Classic Load Balancer (CLB) during installation by enabling it in the `install-config.yaml`. Currently, the Cloud Controller Manager (CCM), which satisfies Service resources, provisions an AWS Load Balancer of type NLB without a Security Group (SG) directly attached to it. Instead, security rules are managed on the worker nodes' security groups.

AWS [announced support for Security Groups when deploying a NLB in August 2023][nlb-supports-sg], and the CCM for AWS (within kubernetes/cloud-provider-aws) does not currently implement the feature of automatically creating and managing a security groups for service type LoadBalancer NLB. While the [AWS Load Balancer Controller (ALBC/LBC)][aws-lbc] project already supports deploying security groups for NLBs, this enhancement focuses on adding minimal, opt-in support to the existing CCM to address immediate customer needs without a full migration to the LBC. This approach aims to provide the necessary functionality without requiring significant changes in other OpenShift components like the Ingress Controller, installer, ROSA, etc.

Using a Network Load Balancer is a recommended network-based Load Balancer by AWS , and attaching a Security Group to an NLB is a security best practice . NLBs also do not support attaching security groups after they are created.

### User Stories

- As an OpenShift administrator, I want to deploy a cluster on AWS (self-managed, ROSA Classic, and ROSA HCP) using a Network Load Balancer with Security Groups in the default router service, so that I can comply with AWS best practices and "security findings"[1].

- As a Developer I want to create the Default Ingress Controller on OpenShift on AWS using a NLB with Security Group

- As a Developer I want to deploy a service type Load Balancer with NLB and security groups (without additional controllers)

- As an OpenShift Engineer of CIO I want the CCM to manage the Security Group when creating service type LB NLB, so it:
  - a) decreases the amount of provider-specific changes on CIO;
  - b) decreases the amount of maitained code/projects by the team (e.g. ALBC);
  - c) enhance new configurations to the Ingress Controller when using NLB;
  - d) decrease the amount of images in the core payload;

- As an OpenShift Engineer, I want to provide an opt-in mechanism for using NLBs with managed Security Groups for the default router, paving the way for potentially making NLB the default LB type in the future.

[1] TODO: "Security Findings" need to be expanded to collect exact examples. This comes from the customer's comment: https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RFE-5440?focusedId=25761057&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-25761057s


### Goals

**Opt-in NLB provisioning with Security Groups for Default Ingress with FULL SG control by CCM**.

Users will be able to deploy OpenShift on AWS with the default Ingress using Network Load Balancers with Security Groups when enabled (opt-in) by setting a configuration in the `install-config.yaml`. The Cluster Ingress Operator (CIO) will create the service manifest with a new annotation to signal the CCM to create and fully manage the Security Group lifecycle for the NLB (similar to CLB, but as opt-in through annotation).

Proposed Phases:

**Phase 1: Create support on Self-Managed**

- OpenShift Install configures the IngressController `default` to use NLB with Security Groups.
- OpenShift Cluster Ingress Controller creates a service type Load Balancer with annotations to use NLB with managed Security Group
- AWS Cloud Controller Manager (CCM) creates the AWS Network Load Balancer with Security Group.

**Phase 2A: Create support on ROSA Classic**

- TBD: Investigate how ROSA Classic (Hive?) reads and reacts to the new option in `install-config`: `platform.aws.ingressController.managedSecurityGroup`. Ensure the CIO manifests are generated correctly.

**Phase 2B: Create support on ROSA HCP**

- TBD: Investigate how Hypershift sets the Service Annotation for Security Group management when launching CIO for Hosted Control Planes.
- TBD: Explore the HCP flow to validate if the self-managed proposed covers it or if specific adjustments are needed.

### Non-Goals

- Migrate to use ALBC as the provisioner on CIO for the default router service (See more in Alternatives).
- Use NLB as the default service type LoadBalancer by the default router.
- Synchronize all NLB features from ALBC to CCM.
- Change the existing CCM flow when deploying NLB without the new opt-in annotation.
- Change the default OpenShift install flow when deploying the default router using IPI (the opt-in flag must be explicitly enabled).

## Proposal

**Opt-in NLB provisioning with Security Groups for Default Ingress with full SG control by CCM**.

Users will be able to deploy OpenShift on AWS with the Default Ingress Controller using Network Load Balancers with a Security Group when enabled (opt-in) by setting a configuration in the `install-config.yaml`. The Cluster Ingress Operator (CIO) will create the service manifest with a new annotation to signal the CCM to create and fully manage the Security Group lifecycle for the NLB (similar to CLB, but as opt-in through annotation).

Proposed Phases (Phases 2* would be able to run in parallel):

**Phase 1: Create support on Self-Managed**

Users will be able to deploy OpenShift on AWS with the default Ingress using Network Load Balancers with Security Groups when enabled (opt-in) in the `install-config.yaml`.

Highlights:
- Focus on short-term resolution of security issues when not using SG on NLB
- Focus on customer scalability when enabling SG on NLB.
- Minimal changes to CCM for initial support.

Goals:
- Installer manifest stage: install-config update to include a flag (`platform.aws.ingressController.managedSecurityGroup`) to enable Security Group management for NLB. The installer updates the CIO manifests based on this flag.
- Cluster-Ingress-Operator:
  - Introduce a new field (`managedSecurityGroup`) in the NLB provider parameters within the IngressController API.
  - Controller creates the Service for the default router with the annotation `service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-type: nlb` and the new annotation `service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-managed-security-group: "true"` when the `managedSecurityGroup` flag is enabled.
- Cloud Controller Manager (CCM):
  - Enable support for the new annotation `service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-managed-security-group: "true"` when creating a service type Load Balancer with `aws-load-balancer-type: nlb`.
  - When the annotation is present, the CCM will:
    - Create a new Security Group instance for the NLB.
    - Create Ingress and Egress rules in the Security Group based on the NLB Listeners and Target Groups' ports. Initially, egress rules should be restricted to the necessary ports for backend communication (traffic and health check ports).
    - Pass the ID of the newly created Security Group during the NLB creation via the AWS API.
    - Delete the Security Group when the corresponding service is deleted.
  - Enhance existing tests for the Load Balancer component in the CCM to include scenarios with the new annotation.

Risk:
- CCM/upstream:
  - SG management increases controller complexity and scenarios to validate.
  - API changes (new annotation).
  - More changes upstream increase the consensus/approvals required, especially for new features in service LB on CCM (prefer ALBC in the long term).
  - More changes in CCM to create and manage the SG lifecycle.
- CCM/downstream:
  - More complex to maintain downstream if not fully upstreamed.

Day-2:
- Self-managed: Patch CIO.

**Phase 2A: Create support on ROSA Classic**

Goals:
- TBD: Investigate how ROSA Classic (Hive?) reads and reacts to the new option in `install-config`: `platform.aws.ingressController.managedSecurityGroup`. Ensure the CIO manifests are generated correctly.

Day-2:
- Managed Services: TBD: Patch CIO.

**Phase 2B: Create support on ROSA HCP**

Goals:
- TBD: Investigate how Hypershift sets the Service Annotation for Security Group management when launching CIO for Hosted Control Planes.
- TBD: Explore the HCP flow to validate if the self-managed proposed covers it or if specific adjustments are needed.

Day-2:
- Managed Services: TBD: Patch CIO.

### Workflow Description

#### OpenShift Self-managed

- User:
  - Creates `install-config.yaml` enabling the use of Security Group, example `platform.aws.ingressController.securityGroupEnabled`, **when** `lbType=NLB` (already exists).
```yaml
# install-config.yaml
platform:
  aws:
    region: us-east-1
    lbType: NLB                   <-- deprecate by platform.aws.ingressController.loadBalancerType?
    ingressController:            <-- proposing to aggregate CIO configurations
      securityGroupEnabled: True  <-- new field
[...]
```
- Installer:
  - The installer will generate the CIO manifests, setting the `managedSecurityGroup` field in the `networkLoadBalancer` section of the IngressController `spec`:
```yaml
# $INSTALL_DIR/manifests/cluster-ingress-default-ingresscontroller.yaml
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: IngressController
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: default
  namespace: openshift-ingress-operator
spec:
[...]
  endpointPublishingStrategy:
    loadBalancer:
      providerParameters:
        aws:
          networkLoadBalancer:
            managedSecurityGroup: true   <-- new field
          type: NLB
        type: AWS
      scope: External
    type: LoadBalancerService
[...]
```
- Cluster Ingress Operator (CIO):
  - CIO will create the Service instance for the default router. If the `spec.endpointPublishingStrategy.loadBalancer.providerParameters.aws.networkLoadBalancer.managedSecurityGroup` is `true`, CIO will include the following annotation in the Service manifest:
```yaml
# Manifest for Service XYZ is created with annotations:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: echoserver
  namespace: mrbraga
  annotations:
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-type: nlb
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-scheme: internet-facing
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-managed-security-group: "true" <-- new annotation
[...]
```
- Cloud Controller Manager (CCM):
  - CCM validates the annotation to manage SG on NLB, creates the SG and rules, and pass the SG ID to LB creation.
  - The annotation `service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-managed-security-group` (new) msut be set to `true`, then creates the SG with required rules for ingress (based on listeners) and egress (based on service and health check ports).
  - CCM LB controller manages the SG lifecycle (controllers may exists in CLB).

  - The CCM's service controller will watch for Service creations and updates.
  - When it encounters a Service with the annotation `service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-managed-security-group: "true"` and `service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-type: nlb`, the CCM will:
    - Create a new AWS Security Group for the NLB. The name should follow a convention like `k8s-elb-a<generated-name-from-service-uid>`.
    - Configure Ingress rules in the Security Group to allow traffic on the ports defined in the Service's `spec.ports`. The source for these rules will be determined by the `service.beta.kubernetes.io/load-balancer-source-ranges` annotation on the Service (if present, otherwise default to allowing from all IPs).
    - Configure Egress rules in the Security Group to allow traffic to the backend pods on the targetPort specified in the Service's `spec.ports` and the health check port. Initially, this should be restricted to the cluster's VPC CIDR or the specific CIDRs of the worker nodes.
    - When creating the NLB using the AWS ELBv2 API, the CCM will include the ID of the newly created Security Group in the `SecurityGroups` parameter of the `CreateLoadBalancerInput.`
  - When the Service annotation is added after the Service is created, the CCM will (?)
  - When the Service is deleted, the CCM will also delete the associated Security Group, ensuring proper cleanup.

#### OpenShift Managed (TBD)

- ROSA Classic:
    - TBD: Ensure the `install-config.yaml` option correctly writes the CIO manifests enabling NLB with managed Security Groups. This might involve changes in the Hive component responsible for cluster provisioning.

- ROSA HCP:
    - TBD: Investigate how Hypershift sets the Service Annotation of Security Group management when launching CIO. The `install-config.yaml` option should influence the Hosted Control Plane's CIO configuration. Need to validate if ROSA HCP follows the pattern of Hypershift or require additional configuration.

### API Extensions

> WIP/TBReviewed

#### AWS Cloud Controller Manager (CCM)

- Introduction of a new annotation constant: `ServiceAnnotationLoadBalancerManagedSecurityGroup = "service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-managed-security-group"` in `pkg/providers/v1/aws.go`.

```go
// ServiceAnnotationLoadBalancerManagedSecurityGroup is the annotation used
// on the service to specify the instruct CCM to manage the security group when creating a Network Load Balancer. When enabled,
// the CCM creates the security group and it's rules. This option can not be used with annotations
// "service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-security-groups" and "service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-extra-security-groups".
const ServiceAnnotationLoadBalancerManagedSecurityGroup = "service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-managed-security-group"
```

- Logic in the service controller within the CCM (`pkg/providers/v1/aws.go` and `pkg/providers/v1/aws_loadbalancer.go` ) to recognize and handle the new annotation when the service type is `NLB` (`ServiceAnnotationLoadBalancerType = "service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-type"` ).
- Functionality within the CCM to create and manage the lifecycle of AWS Security Groups for NLBs, including creating ingress and egress rules based on the service specification. This would likely involve using the AWS SDK for Go to interact with the EC2 API for creating and managing security groups.

#### Cluster Ingress Operator (CIO)

- FeatureGate TechPreview (TODO describe the name?)
- Introduce a new boolean field `managedSecurityGroup` in the `NetworkLoadBalancer` provider parameters within the IngressController API (`operator.openshift.io/v1`).

```go
// AWSNetworkLoadBalancerParameters holds configuration parameters for an
// AWS Network load balancer. For Example: Setting AWS EIPs https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html
type AWSNetworkLoadBalancerParameters struct {
	// managedSecurityGroup specifies whether the service load balancer should create
	// and manage security groups for the Network Load Balancer.
	//
	// +optional
	// +openshift:enable:FeatureGate=IngressNLBSecurityGroup
	ManagedSecurityGroup bool `json:"managedSecurityGroup,omitempty"`
}
```

- The CIO will set the `service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-managed-security-group: "true"` annotation on the default router Service if the `managedSecurityGroup` field in the IngressController spec is set to true.

#### Installer

- Introduce a new boolean field `managedSecurityGroup` under `platform.aws.ingressController` in the `install-config.yaml`. This field will only be considered when `platform.aws.lbType` is `NLB`.

```go
// Platform stores all the global configuration that all machinesets
// use.
type Platform struct {
	// IngressController is an optional extra configuration for the Ingress Controllers.
	// +optional
	IngressController *IngressController `json:"ingressController,omitempty"`
}

// IngressController specifies the additional ingress controller configuration.
type IngressController struct {
	// SecurityGroupEnabled is an optional field to enable security groups
	// when using load balancer type Network Load Balancer (NLB).
	// When this field is enabled with LBType NLB, all ingresscontrollers (including the
	// default ingresscontroller) will be created using security group in the NLBs
	// by default.
	//
	// If this field is not set explicitly, it defaults to no security groups in the NLB.
	// This default is subject to change over time.
	//
	// +optional
	SecurityGroupEnabled bool `json:"securityGroupEnabled,omitempty"`
}
```

- TBD: deprecate the field `platform.aws.lbType` in favor of `platform.aws.ingressController.loadBalancerType`

#### ROSA Classic

- TBD: API changes in Hive to read and process the new install-config option.

#### Hypershift/ROSA HCP

- TBD: API changes in Hypershift to configure CIO based on the install-config option.

### Topology Considerations

#### Hypershift / Hosted Control Planes

- TODO/TBD: The flow needs to be explored to determine how the install-config option propagates to the Hosted Control Plane's CIO configuration. This might involve setting the annotation on the Service created in the guest cluster.

#### Standalone Clusters

<!-- Is the change relevant for standalone clusters? -->

> TODO/TBD: All changes is proposed initially and exclusively for Standalone clusters.


#### Single-node Deployments or MicroShift

> TODO/TBD


### Implementation Details/Notes/Constraints

> WIP/TBReviewed

- The implementation in CCM should handle the case where the `service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-managed-security-group` annotation is set to `true` but the service type is not `NLB` (`aws-load-balancer-type: nlb`). In this scenario, the CCM should likely log a warning mentioning the annotation is supported only on NLB.
- The initial implementation will focus on creating a single Security Group per NLB.
- The Security Group naming convention should be consistent and informative, including the cluster ID, namespace, and service name to aid in identification and management in the AWS console. (TODO: need review, perhaps we just create the same name as LB?)
- Egress rule management in CCM needs careful consideration to avoid overly permissive rules. The initial implementation should restrict egress to the necessary ports and protocols for communication with the backend pods (traffic ports and health check ports) within the cluster's VPC.
- Proper IAM permissions for the CCM's service account will be required to allow it to create, describe, and delete Security Groups in AWS. This needs to be documented as a prerequisite. (TODO review: maybe we don't need this as IAM permissions would be already granted for CLB [review it])

### Risks and Mitigations

> WIP/TBReviewed

- **Increased complexity in CCM**: Adding security group management to CCM increases its complexity. Mitigation: Focus on a minimal and well-tested implementation, drawing inspiration from the existing CLB security group management logic in CCM.   
- **Potential for inconsistencies with ALBC**: If users later decide to migrate to ALBC, there might be inconsistencies in how security groups are managed. Mitigation: Clearly document the limitations of this approach and the benefits of using ALBC for more advanced scenarios or a broader range of features.
- **Maintenance burden**: Maintaining this feature in CCM might become challenging if the upstream cloud-provider-aws project evolves significantly in its load balancer management. Mitigation: Upstream the changes to benefit from community maintenance and align with the long-term strategy for load balancer controllers in OpenShift.
- **IAM Permissions(?)**: Incorrectly configured IAM permissions for the CCM could lead to failures in creating or managing security groups. Mitigation: Provide clear documentation on the necessary IAM permissions and potentially include checks in the CCM to verify these permissions.


### Drawbacks

> WIP/TBReviewed

- The short-term solution requires engineering effort to implement and stabilize the changes in CCM and other components.
- The extent of changes in CCM may require significant engineering effort from Red Hat to maintain this functionality. To mitigate it, this feature proposes minimum changes without disrupting existing flow.
- This approach duplicates some functionality that already exists in the AWS Load Balancer Controller.

## Alternatives (Not Implemented)

> TODO/TBD

### **Defaulting to AWS Load Balancer Controller (ALBC) for the Default Router**:

While ALBC provides more comprehensive support for NLB security groups, this option was deemed out of scope for the initial goal of minimal changes and addressing immediate customer needs for security issues within the existing CCM framework.

Migrating to ALBC would involve significant architectural changes and could potentially impact existing deployments. However, this remains a viable long-term strategy.

Here is an overall effort:
- Determine how ALBC will be managed: Will ALBO be used, or will CCM manage ALBC? Neither ALBO nor ALBC is currently included in the payload. Moving either into the payload requires migrating from CPaaS to Prow and obtaining approval to add a new component to the core payload. When ALBO was created, the guidance was that all new components should be addons, with no new components added to the core payload.
- Migrating from CCM to ALBC would require either disruption to customer workloads (e.g., deleting and recreating the load balancer) or a significant engineering effort to re-architect the way router deployments, load balancers, and DNS are managed. This would involve enabling two ELBs in parallel for the same router deployment, gradually shifting traffic, and then deleting the old ELB.
- Red Hat may need to continue supporting CCM indefinitely for customers unwilling to migrate, meaning this would not be a one-release migration. It would likely require supporting all configurations (CLB with CCM, NLB with CCM, NLB with ALBC) as well as the migration process in perpetuity.
- The above points only scratch the surface of special cases, such as custom security groups, custom DNS configurations, or potential regressions when transitioning from CCM to ALBC.

### **Day-2 operations to switch the default router to use ALBC/LBC**:

This would require users to manually deploy and configure ALBC after cluster installation, which does not meet the requirement for an opt-in during initial cluster deployment.

## Open Questions [optional]

> WIP

- Q: Is it required to create a KEP to the CCM changes?

A: [No][a1]. But we will need to document the feature in the CCM repo.

- Q: Is the annotation name be changed to include "nlb" in the name? There is no similar annotation in ALBC.

- Q: Does the CIO recreates the service when the managed flag is added? Does CCM requires to recreate the NLB when annotation is added?



[a1]: https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1802#discussion_r2101097973

## Test Plan

> WIP/TBReviewed

**cloud-provider-aws (CCM):**:

- e2e service Load Balancer type NLB with Security Groups (SG) needs to be implemented in the CCM component (upstream)

- Implement e2e tests for service Load Balancer type NLB with the `service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-managed-security-group: "true"` annotation. These tests should verify:
  - The creation of an NLB with a newly created and associated Security Group.
  - The correct configuration of Ingress rules in the Security Group based on the service ports and loadBalancerSourceRanges.
  - The configuration of Egress rules, ensuring they are appropriately restricted.
  - The deletion of the Security Group when the service is deleted.
  - The default NLB provisioning behavior when the annotation is absent.
  - The behavior when the annotation is set to true on a non-NLB service type (should result in a warning or error).

**Cluster Ingress Operator (CIO)**:

- Implement e2e tests to verify that the CIO correctly sets the `service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-managed-security-group: "true"` annotation on the default router Service when the corresponding flag is enabled in the IngressController spec.

**installer**:

- Implement a job (dedicated or as part of existing e2e suites) to exercise the e2e flow of enabling Security Group management for NLB during cluster installation by setting the platform.aws.`ingressController.managedSecurityGroup` option in `install-config.yaml`.

> Do we really need a new cluster or just a job rendering the install-config.yaml, then later reuse an existing cluster to create a new ingress controller with rendered manifest?

**API**:

- Unit tests for the new boolean field `managedSecurityGroup` in the IngressController CRD.

## Graduation Criteria

> TODO/TBD

### Dev Preview -> Tech Preview

N/A. This feature will be introduced as Tech Preview.

### Tech Preview -> GA

The E2E tests should be consistently passing and a PR will be created to enable the feature gate by default.

### Removing a deprecated feature

> TODO/TBD: depends on the options.

- Announce deprecation and support policy of the existing lbType configuration (if accepted)
- Deprecate the field

## Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

No upgrade or downgrade concerns are anticipated because all changes are backward-compatible and opt-in. Existing configurations will remain unaffected unless the feature is explicitly enabled.

There is no plan to migrate existing routers with NLB to use Security Groups, as NLBs must be recreated to attach a Security Group. Instead, Day-2 operations must be manually performed, and objects patched if the user wants to consume this feature. For example, users can enable this feature by manually patching the IngressController and associated Service objects to include the required annotations. Note that this may require recreating the NLB, which could result in temporary downtime.

In the case of a downgrade to a CCM version that does not support the `service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-managed-security-group` annotation, the annotation will be ignored, and the Security Group will not be managed by the CCM. Users must manually manage Security Groups in such scenarios.

## Version Skew Strategy

> TODO/TBD

## Operational Aspects of API Extensions

- Monitoring of the CCM for errors related to Security Group creation, rule application, and deletion. Metrics around the number of managed security groups could also be useful.
- Logging in the CCM to track the status of Security Group operations, including creation, updates, and deletions. Include relevant AWS API call details in the logs for debugging.
- Potential for rate limiting on AWS API calls for Security Group management. Implement appropriate backoff and retry mechanisms in the CCM.
- Alerting on failures to create or manage security groups.

## Support Procedures

> TODO/TBD: depends on the options.

Document troubleshooting steps for issues related to NLB Security Group management, including:
- Ensuring the `service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-managed-security-group: "true"` annotation is present on the Service.
- Checking the CCM logs for errors.
- Checking the IAM permissions of the CCM's service account.
- Verifying the presence and configuration of the Network load Balancer and the managed Security Group in the AWS console.
- Providing guidance on common misconfigurations and their resolutions.

## Infrastructure Needed [optional]

> TODO/TBD: depends on the options.

(Double check: probably those permissions is already granted as CLB support manages SG, keeping it here just to review later)

Additional AWS permissions will be required for the CCM's IAM role to create, modify, and delete Security Groups. Specifically, the role will need permissions for ec2:CreateSecurityGroup, ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups, ec2:DeleteSecurityGroup, ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress, ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupEgress, ec2:RevokeSecurityGroupIngress, and ec2:RevokeSecurityGroupEgress.

This needs to be clearly documented as a prerequisite for enabling this feature.
